        Precondition checks are used to validate assumptions made at the start of a test case or

        Identical to `check that` but for use in postcondition checks. Execution will not continue

        Postcondition checks are typically used in reusable keywords. They are added to assert that
        the expected result of the action was achieved successfully. A failing postcondition check
        causes the test case to fail, but indicates that the requirement it was testing for was not
        the cause of failure.

    def check_that(self, *args):
        """
        Check that is used to validate data or state from the system under test.

        Check that takes values and/or robot keywords as input and evaluates the results. If the
        check fails it causes the test case to fail. If all keywords were executed correctly and
        only the check fails, the test will continue to execute remaining keywords and checks.
        
        Check that has two basic forms.
        - A single keyword (with its arguments) can be evaluated to a truth value
        - Two values or keywords (with their arguments) can be evaluated using an operator. It will
          then have the form Check that < ``keyword or value`` > < ``operator`` > < ``keyword or value`` >.

        Operator can be any Robot keyword taking exactly two values (left and right operands) as
        input. A number of predefined operators on numeric, string and list types are included in
        this library.        

        Examples:
        | `Check that` | 3 | `=` | 3 |
        | `Check that` | Two times | 6 | `equals` | 12 |
        | `Check that` | Two times | 5 | `≠` | Two times | 7 |
        | `Check that` | Earth exists |
        
        'Two times' in these examples is assumed to be defined as a Robot keyword that takes one
        argument and multiplies it by 2. Check that will pass if the evaluated result of Two times 9
        equals the fixed expected value 18.

        *Adding time constraints*:\n
                Any check can be extended with an additional timing constraint by adding ``within``
                This will cause the condition to be reevaluated until it becomes true, or until
                the specified time has passed. In the latter case the test case will fail.
                
        Example with time constraint:
        | `Check that` | condition is true | within | 1 minute 30 seconds |
        
        Elevator example:
        | `Check that` | elevator doors are closed |
        | Request elevator at floor | 3 |
        | `Check that` | elevator floor | `equals` | 3 | within | 20 seconds |
        | `Check that` | offset to floor level in mm | `≤` | 5 | within | 3 seconds |
