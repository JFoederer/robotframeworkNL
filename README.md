# robotframeworkNL - the oneliner
robotframeworkNL is a proving ground to boost Robot framework closer to Natural Language.

# Introduction
This project is an extension to [Robot framework](https://robotframework.org/) and although [Robot framework](https://robotframework.org/) made a very good step towards the goals of [keyword-driven testing ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword-driven_testing) to make it readable for all stakeholders, there is still quite a lot of syntax involved that keeps test cases from really staying concise and to-the-point. In this project we will be introducing concepts to lift [Robot framework](https://robotframework.org/) to an even higher level.
